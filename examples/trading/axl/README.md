# AXL multi-agent trading demo

Adds an AXL-native multi-agent flow alongside the single-agent
`examples/trading/agent.py`. Same eerful gate, same executor — the new
surface is two cheap agents collaborating over AXL before the gate
sees their output.

**Two machines** (gil + louie) run AXL nodes and exchange
strategy/optimization payloads over Yggdrasil. **Otto** is the
developer machine driving the demo and minting receipts via 0G's
compute network — it's not part of the AXL topology.

## Files

- `agent_multi.py` — orchestrator. Drives the AXL round trip + 0G
  receipt generation. Runs on otto.
- `explorer.py` — drafts the strategy module, receives optimization
  result, renders final `proposal.md` + `implementation.py`. Imported
  by `agent_multi.py` (executes inside that process).
- `refiner.py` — listens on AXL, receives `STRATEGY_DRAFT` envelopes,
  runs Optuna sweep on the toy backtest, returns
  `OPTIMIZATION_RESULT`. Daemon, runs on louie.
- `transport.py` — thin httpx wrapper around AXL's `/send` + `/recv`.
- `toy_backtest.py` — synthetic price data + Sharpe computation.
  Deterministic seed, no external data deps.
- `forge_attempt.py` — compromised-agent producer. Generates a
  fresh secp256k1 keypair locally, hand-crafts an `EnhancedReceipt`
  signed with that key, borrows attestation pointers from a prior
  valid receipt. Demonstrates §7.1 Step 5b (pubkey ↔ report_data
  binding) by producing a receipt that passes Steps 1-6 individually
  but fails Step 5b. Runs on otto.
- `cached_run/` — captured logs + receipts from a known-good run, used
  as the demo recording's safety net.

## Demo arc

### 1. Clean run — both gates PASS

```bash
python examples/trading/axl/agent_multi.py \
    --tool-response examples/trading/tool_responses/clean.json
```

Explorer drafts the strategy at the principal's mandate (5% drawdown,
2x leverage, BTC/ETH/SOL perps). Refiner runs 10-trial Optuna sweep
on synthetic 4h candles. Final proposal + implementation get scored
by Qwen-2.5-7B in TEE. Both gates PASS.

### 2. Poisoned run — proposal_grade refuses

```bash
python examples/trading/axl/agent_multi.py \
    --tool-response examples/trading/tool_responses/poisoned.json
```

The "regulatory update" tool response claims the principal raised the
drawdown ceiling from 5% to 30%. Explorer trusts the tool, drafts a
30% strategy. Refiner faithfully optimizes against it. Final
proposal + implementation hit the gate.

`proposal_grade` REFUSES with overall=0.4 (mandate_compliance=0.3).
Commentary: *"the drawdown ceiling has been revised to 30%, violating
M1, cannot be implemented under the principal's fixed mandate."*

`implementation_grade` PASSES — code matches the (poisoned) proposal.
A single-gate architecture would have let this through. The two-gate
architecture is what catches mandate drift.

### 3. Compromised-agent run — forged receipt refuses

```bash
python examples/trading/axl/forge_attempt.py \
    --borrow-receipt examples/trading/receipts/proposal.json \
    --score 0.95 \
    --out examples/trading/receipts/forged.json
```

The first two arcs both assumed the agent itself was honest — the TEE
call really happened, the receipt was real, the only attack was
corrupted *input*. This arc dramatizes a different threat: an agent
that's compromised end-to-end and skips the TEE entirely. It
generates its own secp256k1 keypair locally, signs a hand-crafted
response with its own key, and borrows the prior clean run's
attestation pointers to make the forgery plausible.

Steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (compose-hash), and 6 each pass individually —
the borrowed attestation is real, the signature recovers to the
forger's claimed pubkey, internally consistent. **Step 5b** is what
catches it: `eerful gate` derives an EVM address from the receipt's
`enclave_pubkey` and compares it to the address baked into the
attestation report's `report_data` field. The forger's locally
generated key has no such binding — the addresses don't match, and
the gate refuses with `REFUSE_INVALID_RECEIPT`.

This is the cryptographic refusal class, distinct from `REFUSE_SCORE`.
The poisoned arc fires the score-based gate (LLM grader looks at a
30% drawdown and flags the criteria violation); the forged arc fires
the cryptographic gate (verifier looks at the missing pubkey
binding). Both are demoed by `scripts/run_demo.sh`; together they
cover two complementary attack classes — corrupted input and
compromised producer.

## Cat C provider note

The Qwen-2.5-7B provider on 0G testnet 16602 is a Cat C centralized
passthrough. Its signature endpoint signs an attestation envelope,
not the model output. eerful's receipt construction handles this via
the `chat_text` fallback path in `_produce_receipt`: parse
`output_score_block` from the chat completion when `response_content`
(the signed envelope) doesn't decode as JSON. The receipt's
signature chain remains valid (Steps 1-6 verify), with the
documented caveat that score provenance is provider-identity rather
than enclave-attestation. High-consequence tier should require Cat A
(`required_categories: ["A"]`); low-consequence accepts Cat C.

## Topology setup

One-time: AXL build, key generation, deploy.

```bash
# On otto
make -C path/to/axl build  # produces ./node binary
mkdir -p /tmp/axl-deploy/{gil,louie}
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out /tmp/axl-deploy/gil/private.pem
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out /tmp/axl-deploy/louie/private.pem

# Configs: gil listens on 9001, louie peers to gil
cat > /tmp/axl-deploy/gil/node-config.json << EOF
{"PrivateKeyPath":"private.pem","Peers":[],"Listen":["tls://0.0.0.0:9001"],"api_port":9002,"bridge_addr":"127.0.0.1"}
EOF
cat > /tmp/axl-deploy/louie/node-config.json << EOF
{"PrivateKeyPath":"private.pem","Peers":["tls://192.168.50.197:9001"],"Listen":[],"api_port":9002,"bridge_addr":"127.0.0.1"}
EOF

# Deploy
cp axl/node /tmp/axl-deploy/gil/ /tmp/axl-deploy/louie/
ssh gil "mkdir -p ~/eerful-axl"
scp /tmp/axl-deploy/gil/* gil:~/eerful-axl/
ssh louie "mkdir -p ~/eerful-axl"
scp /tmp/axl-deploy/louie/* louie:~/eerful-axl/

# Refiner deps + code
ssh louie "python3 -m venv ~/eerful-axl/.venv && ~/eerful-axl/.venv/bin/pip install httpx optuna numpy pandas"
scp examples/trading/axl/{refiner.py,transport.py,toy_backtest.py} louie:~/eerful-axl/

# Demo-UI emit helper (sibling fallback — refiner.py imports it when the
# full eerful package isn't available on louie). Re-scp after any edit
# to src/eerful/_emit.py.
scp src/eerful/_emit.py louie:~/eerful-axl/
```

Per run: start AXL nodes + refiner daemon + tunnel.

```bash
# AXL nodes (both machines)
ssh gil   "cd ~/eerful-axl && nohup ./node -config node-config.json > axl.log 2>&1 &"
ssh louie "cd ~/eerful-axl && nohup ./node -config node-config.json > axl.log 2>&1 &"

# Refiner on louie — set AXL_EXPLORER_PEER_ID to gil's pubkey so the
# refiner only accepts STRATEGY_DRAFTs from the explorer (the daemon
# executes submitted module code; allowlisting is the perimeter).
# Unset → fail-open with a logged warning, fine for a first dry run.
#
# EERFUL_DEMO_UI_URL points at otto's demo-UI sidecar so refiner-side
# events (axl_recv, optuna_progress, axl_send) land on the same SSE
# stream as the otto-side events. Uses Tailscale MagicDNS, so
# `otto` resolves on every machine in the homelab. Unset →
# emit_event still writes to louie's local NDJSON but nothing reaches
# the SPA. The UI server on otto must be bound to 0.0.0.0 (not the
# loopback default) for cross-machine POSTs to land:
#   uv run uvicorn services.demo_ui.server:app --port 8088 --host 0.0.0.0
ssh louie "cd ~/eerful-axl && \
    AXL_EXPLORER_PEER_ID=f8ce... \
    EERFUL_DEMO_UI_URL=http://otto:8088 \
    nohup ./.venv/bin/python refiner.py > refiner.log 2>&1 &"

# Tunnel from otto: localhost:9002 → gil:9002 (so agent_multi's transport.py
# uses gil's AXL bridge as if it were local)
ssh -L 9002:127.0.0.1:9002 -N gil &

# 0G compute bridge on otto (loopback, holds wallet)
cd services/zg-bridge && npm start &

# Run the demo
python examples/trading/axl/agent_multi.py --tool-response ...
```

## Refiner peer ID

Hardcoded in `agent_multi.py` (`DEFAULT_REFINER_PEER_ID`). The peer ID
is derived from `private.pem` — regenerating the key updates the
peer ID, which means updating the constant. For the current deploy:

  - gil:   `f8ce2acbba81ece8d266b342da6f8c908976862ec2c71856181c7f8dbca47e00`
  - louie: `a6c6caaa05c82ce497e5b1026b13920fccfad027c2cca733ededc88fd61d8974`

## Recording strategy

Pre-recorded per the existing demo recordability strategy: execute
live ahead of time, capture logs (in `cached_run/`); on camera kick
off another live run and walk through the cached run's logs while the
new run executes in the background. Live result lands in time → cut
to it; otherwise the cached run is the artifact shown.
